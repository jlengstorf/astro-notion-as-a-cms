# Notion as a CMS for Astro

This is an experiment using Astro’s content collections to use Notion as a CMS powering a blog.

A custom loader hits a Notion database, with each page in the database being used as an individual blog post.

This is very bare bones and very much limited to my specific use case, but it’s here as a good starting point if you want to do something similar.
